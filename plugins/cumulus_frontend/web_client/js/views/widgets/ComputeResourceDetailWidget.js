/**
 * This view is in charge of viewing the details on an individual compute
 * resource, which is one or more machines as part of a cluster.
 * This panel is backed by a single compute resource model.
 *
 * The majority of the logic in this panel pertains to the live streaming
 * of log events occurring.
 * A ComputeResource is considered "working" if it is in the middle of doing
 * anything that involves streaming output from Ansible playbooks back to Girder.
 *
 * Raw logs are stored as part of the cluster, and an abbreviated log that most
 * users will probably look at is stored in the model's abbrev_log attribute.
 *
 * When the view is initialized, an event stream is opened if the resource is working.
 * Otherwise, logs are fetched and processed for viewing.
 *
 * Event Listening
 * 1) If the model is changed then the modal contents need to be re-rendered. Additional
 * care is taken to close the event stream if the resource moves from a working to a
 * non-working state.
 * 2) If the modal is hidden, the event stream is closed and we stop listening for model
 * changes. This is because each compute resource can have its own modal with streaming output.
